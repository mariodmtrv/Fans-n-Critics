Fans-n-Critics
==============

Choosing a movie shouldn't take longer than watching it, right?
All those reviews are stacked with so many spoilers 
that you don't even want to go to the cinema afterwards?
Welcome Fans and Critics - all you need to decide at one place. 
We collect all those reviews and ratings that matter.
Whether it's what Average Joe has to say, or that shiny new critic, 
our little aliens will read those reviews carefully and tell whether 
the movie is worth it.
Vox populi - thousands have watched and voted already and if the masses know best, we know even better.
IMDB, RottenTomato... all the ratings are here for your decision.
We were not all created the same and why should we watch the same things? 
TrustSense adapts to your choices automatically and finds out whether that
critic is really on your wave.
Like, share, vote - your opinion really matters.
Why wait anymore for the best - sign up today*, it's completely free!
